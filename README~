genomedrawer is a small javascript library to create images representing genome or protein annotations similar to those found on Ensembl or the UCSC Genome Browser.

It depends on Raphael to do the drawing and should support any major browser (including IE). 

jQuery is used in the testing pages, but the library does not.

Some amount of configuration/customization is allowed.
